abstract = {The purpose of this study was to compare two ways of estimating both fatigue and fitness indicators from systems model of the effects of training on performance. The model was applied to data concerning the training of a hammer thrower. The variations in performance were mathematically related to the successive amounts of training. The model equation was composed of negative (NF) and positive (PF) functions. The NF and PF were associated with the fatigue and fitness estimated in previous studies. Using another method, fatigue and fitness indicators were estimated from a combination of NF and PF. The influence of training on performance was negatively associated with fatigue (NI), and positively to fitness (PI). The changes in performance were well described by the model in the present study (r = 0.96, N = 19, P{\textless}0.001). Significant correlations were observed between NF and NI (r = 0.93, P {\textless} 0.001) on the one hand and between PF and PI (r = 0.90, P {\textless} 0.001) on the other. The absolute values and the time variations of PI and NI were closer to the change in performance than NF and PF. The NF and PF were accounted for mainly by the accumulation of amounts of training. On the other hand, NI and PI were accounted for rather by the impact of these amounts of training on performance. {\textcopyright} 1994 Springer-Verlag.},

@article{Hellard2006,
abstract = {The aim of this study was to carry out a statistical analysis of the Banister model to verify how useful it is in monitoring the training programmes of elite swimmers. The accuracy, the ill-conditioning and the stability of this model were thus investigated. The training loads of nine elite swimmers, measured over one season, were related to performances with the Banister model. First, to assess accuracy, the 95{\%} bootstrap confidence interval (95{\%} CI) of parameter estimates and modelled performances were calculated. Second, to study ill-conditioning, the correlation matrix of parameter estimates was computed. Finally, to analyse stability, iterative computation was performed with the same data but minus one performance, chosen at random. Performances were related to training loads for all participants (R2 = 0.79 Â± 0.13, P {\textless} 0.05) and the estimation procedure seemed to be stable. Nevertheless, the range of 95{\%} CI values of the most useful parameters for monitoring training was wide: $\tau$ = 38 (17, 59), $\tau$f = 19 (6, 32), tn = 19 (7, 35), tg =43 (25, 61). Furthermore, some parameters were highly correlated, making their interpretation worthless. We suggest possible ways to deal with these problems and review alternative methods to model the training - performance relationships. {\textcopyright} 2006 Taylor {\&} Francis.},
annote = {Bottomline: this Banister model has some identifiability issues, yet results in 'good predictions' . However, there is always limited data and the parameters might not be physically related to anything. 

things to check still:
- how were predictions made
- how was bootstrapping used here},

@article{Taha2003,
abstract = {Mathematical models may provide a method of describing and predicting the effect of training on performance. The current models attempt to describe the effects of single or multiple bouts of exercise on the performance of a specific task on a given day. These models suggest that any training session increases fitness and provokes a fatigue response. Various methods of quantifying the training stimulus (training impulse, absolute work, psychophysiological rating) and physical performance (criterion scale, arbitrary units) are employed in these models. The models are empirical descriptions and do not use current knowledge regarding the specificity of training adaptations. Tests of these models with published data indicate discrepancies between the predicted and measured time course of physiological adaptations, and between the predicted and measured performance responses to training. The relationship between these models and the underlying physiology requires clarification. New functional models that incorporate specificity of training and known physiology are required to enhance our ability to guide athletic training, rehabilitation and research.},
